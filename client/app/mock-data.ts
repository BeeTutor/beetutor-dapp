We will explore the possibilities they offer for building applications on a solid digital foundation of trust and examine how these technologies can make the Internet safe. It's quite a challenge!

At the moment, to open a new account you need to register with each new service provider and prove your identity, and each time, to access, you need to prove your identity by entering your password and credentials. A decentralized identity would radically simplify such a process. It should satisfy certain principles to ensure that it does not have the same problems and limitations as the previous models.`,
